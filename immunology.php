                            <p>Immunology is the study of the body's immune system and its functions and disorders. Serology is the study of blood serum (the clear fluid that separates when blood clots).
                            Immunology is the branch of biomedical science that deals with the response of an organism to antigenic challenge and its recognition of what is self and what is not. It deals with the defence mechanisms including all physical, chemical and biological properties of the organism that help it to combat its susceptibility to foreign organisms, material, etc.</p>
                            <p>The use of the diagnostic clinical immunology tools is generally focused on the diagnosis or prevention of infectious disease, diagnosis of immune deficiency, detection of autoimmune responses, and diagnosis of hypersensitivity conditions. a variety of immune tests are used to help establish a diagnosis of autoimmune disease.</p>

                            <p class="mt-3 mb-2">Immunology and serology laboratories focus on the following:
                                <ul>
                                 
                                <li class="pl-0">•	Identifying antibodies. These are proteins made by a type of white blood cell in response to a foreign substance (antigen) in the body.</li>
	                            <li>•	Investigating problems with the immune system. These include when the body's immune system attacks its own tissues (autoimmune diseases) and when a body's immune system is underactive (immunodeficiency disorders).</li>
	                            <li>•	Determining organ, tissue, and fluid compatibility for transplantation.</li>
	                            <li>•	Immunology and serology tests helps in the diagnosis of Infections, Autoimmune disorders, Cancers, Chronic diseases, Allergies, Rheumatoid factor, Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) typing, etc.</li>

                                </ul>

                                <!-- <p>An immunoassay is a biochemical test that measures the presence or concentration of a macromolecule or a small molecule in a solution through the use of an antibody (usually) or an antigen (sometimes). The molecule detected by the immunoassay is often referred to as an "analyte" and is in many cases a protein, although it may be other kinds of molecules, of different sizes and types, as long as the proper antibodies that have the required properties for the assay are developed. Analytes in biological liquids such as serum or urine are frequently measured using immunoassays for medical and research purposes.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">Immunoassays come in many different formats and variations. Immunoassays may be run in multiple steps with reagents being added and washed away or separated at different points in the assay. Multi-step assays are often called separation immunoassays or heterogeneous immunoassays. Some immunoassays can be carried out simply by mixing the reagents and sample and making a physical measurement. Such assays are called homogeneous immunoassays, or less frequently non-separation immunoassays.</p>
                                <p class="mb-30">The use of a calibrator is often employed in immunoassays. Calibrators are solutions that are known to contain the analyte in question, and the concentration of that analyte is generally known. Comparison of an assay's response to a real sample against the assay's response produced by the calibrators makes it possible to interpret the signal strength in terms of the presence or concentration of an analyte in the sample.</p>
                                <p>A wide range of medical tests are immunoassays, called immunodiagnostics in this context. Many home pregnancy tests are immunoassays, which detect the pregnancy marker human chorionic gonadotropin. Other clinical immunoassays include tests that measure levels of CK-MB to assess heart disease, insulin to assess hypoglycemia, the prostate-specific antigen to detect prostate cancer, and some are also used for the detection and/or quantitative measurement of some pharmaceutical compounds.</p> -->
